    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Assignment 1: Fade!</h1>
    <div class="vertical">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        First, I created a schematic (below) for a button that is read to 
        activate 3 fading LEDs (that can also act independently). I used this 
        to implement the circuit on my breadboard connected to my Arduino. 
        Then, I wrote firmware in an .ino file to execute a scenario where a 
        button press causes a sequence of 3 fading LEDs in order.

      <h2>Resistance Calculations</h2>
      <p>I used green, yellow, and red LEDs that each have a 1.8V drop.</p>
      <p>5V - 1.8V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>3.2V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>R = 3.2V / 0.02A</p>
      <p>R = 160立</p>
      <p>This means that each LED requires a resistance of at least 160立. 
        Therefore, I used a 220立 resistor for each light, as that is the 
        closest value over 160. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For the button, a 10k立 resistor is the standard to use. Without it,  
        the Arduino's input is left "floating" when the button isn't pressed. 
        The 10k resistor "pulls" the input to GND so it has a defined state.
        10k is small enough to reliably pull the input to GND while still 
        large enough that only a small current is drawn when the input is 
        connected to power.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, choosing pins 11, 10, and 9 to connect my 
          LEDs that I want to fade as these pins work with analogWrite(). I chose 
          green, yellow, and red to output the lights. These three LEDs have independent 
          paths from the pins to ground, separate from the button as I later code so that 
          they activate after reading the state of the button. For the button, it starts 
          from power (5V) and pin 2 to allocate power for when the button is off, and ends
          at ground.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        Then, I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement a pattern of blinking 
        lights. The order goes: yellow, green, then red light up, then yellow, green, 
        red turns off. Full code below.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int G = 11; // the pin the green LED is attached to 
        int Y = 10; // the pin the yellow LED is attached to 
        int R = 9; // the pin the red LED is attached to 

        // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
        void setup() {
          pinMode(G, OUTPUT); // initializing G pin as an output
          pinMode(Y, OUTPUT); // initializing G pin as an output
          pinMode(R, OUTPUT); // initializing G pin as an output
          pinMode(2, INPUT); // initializing pin 2 as an input (for button)
        }

        // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
        void loop() {
          int buttonState = digitalRead(2); // initializing buttonState to read whether button has been pressed

          if (buttonState){ // only if the button has been pressed the below happens
            for(int i = 192; i > 0;i--){ // starts a loop for green LED to fade, starting at i and fading to 0
              analogWrite(G, i); // turns green LED on to i state
              delay(5); // delays next loop for 5 ms
              digitalWrite(G, LOW); // turns green LED off once it fades to 0
          }
            for(int i = 192; i > 0;i--){ // starts a loop for yellow LED to fade, starting at i and fading to 0
              analogWrite(Y, i); // turns yellow LED on to i state
              delay(5); // delays next loop for 5 ms
              digitalWrite(Y, LOW); // turns yellow LED off once it fades to 0
            }
            for(int i = 192; i > 0;i--){ // starts a loop for red LED to fade, starting at i and fading to 0
              analogWrite(R, i); // turns red LED on to i state
              delay(5); // delays next loop for 5 ms
              digitalWrite(R, LOW); // turns red LED off once it fades to 0
            }
          } 
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>Here is the final output operation!</p>

            1. Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage.

            2. Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing 
            that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if 
            powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Battery life is equal to capacity (mAh) over current drawn (mA). If the 
            battery is powered by 1200 mAh and each LED draws 20mA, then the equation 
            would be:
          </p>
          <p>Battery life (hours) = 1200 mAh / (20 mA * 3 LEDs)</p>
          <p>Battery life (hours) = 1200 mAh / 60 mA</p>
          <p>Battery life = 20 hours</p>
          <p>My circuit would run for approximately 20 hours if powered by a 1200 
            mAh battery.
