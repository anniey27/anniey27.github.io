      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I created schematics (below) for two components: a capacitive sensor and a 
        servo motor. For the capacitive sensor, it receives a signal through pin 2, 
        which is routed through a 1 megaohm resistor to pin 4. When you touch a metal 
        object (connected through an alligator clip), it triggers a change in 
        capacitance, sending a signal back to the system that it can read from (which 
        will decide when the servo will change positions). The 1 megaohm resistor is 
        needed for absolute touch on the object to activate a signal. Meanwhile, the 
        servo motor receives power and a pulse signal from pin 9, and connects to 
        ground.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, connecting my LEDs to pin 9 and 10. The joystick 
          is on its own. It grabs power from 5V and connects to ground. VRx and VRy read from 
          analog pins A0 and A1. Lastly, SW on the joystick is the switch, which functions by 
          outputting a digital signal if the joystick is moved. This is connected to digital 
          pin 3.
