    <div class="vertical">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I created schematics (below) for two components: a capacitive sensor and a 
        servo motor. Both of these require libraries! For the capacitive sensor, it 
        receives a signal through pin 2, 
        which is routed through a 1 megaohm resistor to pin 4. When you touch a metal 
        object (connected through an alligator clip), it triggers a change in 
        capacitance, sending a signal back to the system that it can read from (which 
        will decide when the servo will change positions). The 1 megaohm resistor is 
        needed (standard) for absolute touch on the object to activate a signal. 
        Meanwhile, the servo motor receives power and a pulse signal from pin 9, and 
        connects to ground.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, connecting my LEDs to pin 9 and 10. The joystick 
          is on its own. It grabs power from 5V and connects to ground. VRx and VRy read from 
          analog pins A0 and A1. Lastly, SW on the joystick is the switch, which functions by 
          outputting a digital signal if the joystick is moved. This is connected to digital 
          pin 3.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement a circuit where as soon as the 
        sensor reads that the metal object has been directly touched, the servo motor 
        position turns 180 degrees. It stays unmoving at 0 degrees otherwise. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the serial monitor to read the sensor values and test what value would be 
        best to use as the threshhold value for the system to know the metal object was 
        touched. Realizing that at neutral/sitting/no-touching the sensor value is less 
        than 100 and that touching the object brings it up to around 2000, I set the touch 
        threshhold value to be at 1000. So the servo motor only changes position if that it 
        senses the threshhold value or above it.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // adding libraries for the capacitive sensor and servo
        #include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
        #include <Servo.h>

        // initializing capacitive sensor
        CapacitiveSensor cs_4_2 = CapacitiveSensor(4, 2); // input from pin 2 to pin 4

        // initializing and defining servo
        Servo myservo;

        // threshhold to know when the metal object has been touched (based on serial monitor readings)
        const int TOUCH_THRESHOLD = 1000; 

        void setup() {
            // beginning serial monitor
            Serial.begin(9600);

            //attaching servo to pin 9
            myservo.attach(9);
        }

        void loop() {
            // reads the sensor to see if the metal object was touched
            long touch = cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30); // takes 30 readings and returns sum of the results

            // printing raw sensor values for debugging
            Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
            Serial.println(touch);

            // delay for stability
            delay(10);

            // if touched, the servo motor updates position
            if (touch > TOUCH_THRESHOLD) {
                // servo updates position to 180 degrees
                myservo.write(180);

            // if not touched, the servo motors is unmoving or goes back to 0
            } else {
                // servo motor updates or stays at position of 0 degrees
                myservo.write(0);
            }

            // delay for stability
            delay(50); 
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Here is the final output operation! As you can see, every time I touch the 
        metal object, the servo arm's position turns 180 degrees. And it comes right 
        back to 0 once my finger is not on the object anymore. Yes, I had the motor 
        turn left so I guess you can say it's turning to -180 degrees.

        <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
        <div class="A1questions">
          <div class="vertical">
            <h3>
            1. Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
            <p><pre><code>for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}</code></p></pre>Draw a graph 
            with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to 
            ground.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Pin 9 sends the PWM (pulse width modulation) signal to the servo, and the width of 
              the signal determines the servo's position. It varies between 1 ms and 2 ms and the 
              voltage alternates between 0V and 5V. For a fixed period of 20 ms, the pulse width 
              increases from 1ms to 20ms. As the voltage oscillates between 0V and 5V, the amount 
              of time the signal is at 5V gradually increases while the amount of time that the 
              signal is at 0V gradually decreases. The PWM signal changes to control the servo's 
              position.
