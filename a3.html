      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        First, I created a schematic (below) for a joystick that will be read  
        to activate 2 different LEDs at different levels of brightness depending on 
        the x and y values the joystick is moved to. These are all independent from 
        each other. I used this to implement the circuit on my breadboard connected 
        to my Arduino. Then, I wrote firmware in an .ino file to connect the joystick 
        and LEDs together using analogRead, analogWrite, map, and more. I created a 
        scenario where if you moved the joystick left or right, that determines the LED
        that gets affected by wherever the joystick is moved up or down, which affects 
        brightness/dimness of that particular LED.

      <h2>Resistance and Voltage Divider Calculations</h2>
      <p>I used red and green LEDs that each have a 1.8V drop.</p>
      <p>5V - 1.8V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>3.2V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>R = 3.2V / 0.02A</p>
      <p>R = 160Ω</p>
      <p>This means that each LED requires a resistance of at least 160Ω. 
        Therefore, I used a 220Ω resistor for each light, as that is the 
        closest value over 160. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For the joystick, I did not use a resistor because it has internal
        potentiometers which are standardly 10kΩ each. 10kΩ allows for a good, 
        reliable balance between sensitivity and accuracy for most joystick 
        applications. This allows for a wide range of voltage output with control. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The two potentiometers in the joystick essentially act as voltage dividers, 
        eliminating the need for any external ones. They each divide the total supply 
        voltage (5V) by a fraction that changes depending on the joystick's position, 
        sending that output to x and y. We use analogRead() for the two analog input 
        pins associated with x and y to obtain the values that correspond with those 
        positions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The values we might read at the voltage divider would range between 0V (analog 
        reading = 0) and 5V (analog reading = 1023). At neutral position, it would read 
        around 2.5V and the analog reading = 512. To calculate the voltage at any time, 
        we would use V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> * [<numerator>R<sub>down</sub> 
        </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (R<sub>down</sub> + R<sub>up</sub>)</denominator>]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we know each potentiometer is 10kΩ, so at neutral position, R<sub>down</sub> 
        = 5000Ω and R<sub>up</sub> = 5000Ω. Therefore, the voltage out at this time would be 5V 
        * [<numerator>5000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (5000Ω + 5000Ω)</denominator>] = 5V 
        * [<numerator>5000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (10000Ω)</denominator>] = 5V * 0.5 
        = 2.5V. 
      </p>

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, connecting my LEDs to pin 9 and 10. The joystick 
          is on its own. It grabs power from 5V and connects to ground. VRx and VRy read from 
          analog pins A0 and A1. Lastly, SW on the joystick is the switch, which functions by 
          outputting a digital signal if the joystick is moved. This is connected to digital 
          pin 3.
