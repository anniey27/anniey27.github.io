      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        First, I created a schematic (below) for a joystick that will be read  
        to activate 2 different LEDs at different levels of brightness depending on 
        the x and y values the joystick is moved to. These are all independent from 
        each other. I used this to implement the circuit on my breadboard connected 
        to my Arduino. Then, I wrote firmware in an .ino file to connect the joystick 
        and LEDs together using analogRead, analogWrite, map, and more. I created a 
        scenario where if you moved the joystick left or right, that determines the LED
        that gets affected by wherever the joystick is moved up or down, which affects 
        brightness/dimness of that particular LED.
