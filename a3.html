      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        First, I created a schematic (below) for a joystick that will be read  
        to activate 2 different LEDs at different levels of brightness depending on 
        the x and y values the joystick is moved to. These are all independent from 
        each other. I used this to implement the circuit on my breadboard connected 
        to my Arduino. Then, I wrote firmware in an .ino file to connect the joystick 
        and LEDs together using analogRead, analogWrite, map, and more. I created a 
        scenario where if you moved the joystick left or right, that determines the LED
        that gets affected by wherever the joystick is moved up or down, which affects 
        brightness/dimness of that particular LED.

      <h2>Resistance and Voltage Divider Calculations</h2>
      <p>I used red and green LEDs that each have a 1.8V drop.</p>
      <p>5V - 1.8V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>3.2V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>R = 3.2V / 0.02A</p>
      <p>R = 160Ω</p>
      <p>This means that each LED requires a resistance of at least 160Ω. 
        Therefore, I used a 220Ω resistor for each light, as that is the 
        closest value over 160. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For the joystick, I did not use a resistor because it has internal
        potentiometers which are standardly 10kΩ each. 10kΩ allows for a good, 
        reliable balance between sensitivity and accuracy for most joystick 
        applications. This allows for a wide range of voltage output with control. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The two potentiometers in the joystick essentially act as voltage dividers, 
        eliminating the need for any external ones. They each divide the total supply 
        voltage (5V) by a fraction that changes depending on the joystick's position, 
        sending that output to x and y. We use analogRead() for the two analog input 
        pins associated with x and y to obtain the values that correspond with those 
        positions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The values we might read at the voltage divider would range between 0V (analog 
        reading = 0) and 5V (analog reading = 1023). At neutral position, it would read 
        around 2.5V and the analog reading = 512. To calculate the voltage at any time, 
        we would use V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> * [<numerator>R<sub>1</sub> 
        </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>)</denominator>]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we know each potentiometer is 10kΩ, so at neutral position, R<sub>1</sub> 
        = 5000Ω and R<sub>2</sub> = 5000Ω. Therefore, the voltage out at this time would be 5V 
        * [<numerator>5000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (5000Ω + 5000Ω)</denominator>] = 5V 
        * [<numerator>5000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (10000Ω)</denominator>] = 5V * 0.5 
        = 2.5V. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="vertical">
        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, connecting my LEDs to pin 9 and 10. The joystick 
          is on its own. It grabs power from 5V and connects to ground. VRx and VRy read from 
          analog pins A0 and A1. Lastly, SW on the joystick is the switch, which functions by 
          outputting a digital signal if the joystick is moved. This is connected to digital 
          pin 3.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        Then, I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement a scenario where the 
        joystick's x-axis determines which of the two LEDs will be activated while the 
        y-axis determines the brightness/dimness of the respective LED. On the x-axis, 
        Left side means red LED while right side is green; on the y-axis, up means dim, 
        down is bright. For example, if I were to move the joystick to the top left, the 
        red light would be at its dimmest (and also the green would be at neutral 
        brightness), and if I were to move the joystick to the bottom right, the green 
        light would be at its brightest (while red is at neutral brightness). Note: if y 
        is at neutral position (has not been moved up or down), the LED would be at neutral 
        brightness. Full code is below.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        const int analogOutPin9 = 9;  // analog output pin the red LED is attached to
        const int analogOutPin10 = 10; // analog output pin the green LED is attached to
        const int x = A0; // analog input pin to read the x value from the joystick
        const int y = A1; // analog input pin to read the y value from the joystick

        int xval = 0; // initializing xval
        int yval = 0; // initializing yval
        int outputYValue = 0;  // initializing outputYValue

        void setup() {
          Serial.begin(9600); // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
        }

        void loop() {
          xval = analogRead(x); // reading the analog from joystick for x value
          yval = analogRead(y); // reading the analog from joystick for y value

          outputYValue = map(yval, 0, 1023, 0, 255); // mapping y value for output 0-255

          // xval determines which pin (LED) is being affected, yval determines the voltage allocated to that LED (brightness/dimness)
          if (xval < 512) { // if joystick is moved from neutral to left (up to where x = 0), pin 9 is the output
            analogWrite(analogOutPin9, outputYValue); // changing analog out y value for pin 9
          } else if (xval > 512) { // if joystick is moved from neutral to right (up to where x = 255), pin 10 is the output
            analogWrite(analogOutPin10, outputYValue); // changing analog out y value for pin 10
          } 
          // else both LEDs stay on at neutral y value brightness
          
          // checking what x and y read from the joystick on the serial monitor, this helped me check my scenario was working
          Serial.print("x = ");
          Serial.println(outputXValue);
          Serial.print("y = ");
          Serial.println(outputYValue);
        }

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <div class="A1questions">

          <h3>
            1. In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 
            or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example 
            calculations.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The variable resistor (or the potentiometers in my joystick in this case) can 
            be either R<sub>1</sub> or R<sub>2</sub>, it doesn't matter. However, they will 
            differ in the range of voltage it can output as resistance changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's say it was R<sub>2</sub> first. My equation is: V<sub>out</sub> = V<sub>in</sub> 
            * [<numerator>R<sub>1</sub> </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> (R<sub>1</sub> + R
              <sub>2</sub>)</denominator>]. So R<sub>2</sub> can vary from 0 to 10kΩ, 
            while R<sub>1</sub> stays fixed at 10kΩ. If R<sub>2</sub> = 0Ω, then V<sub>out</sub> 
            = 5V * [<numerator>10000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> 10000Ω + 0</denominator>] 
            = 5V * 1 = <b>5V</b>. If R<sub>2</sub> = 10000Ω, then V<sub>out</sub> = 5V * [<numerator>
              10000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> 10000Ω + 10000Ω</denominator>] = 5V * 0.5 = 
              <b>2.5V</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let's say it was R<sub>1</sub>. So R<sub>1</sub> can vary from 0 to 10kΩ, 
            while R<sub>2</sub> stays fixed at 10kΩ. If R<sub>1</sub> = 0Ω, then V<sub>out</sub> 
            = 5V * [<numerator>0 </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> 0 + 10000Ω</denominator>] 
            = 5V * 0 = <b>0V</b>. If R<sub>1</sub> = 10000Ω, then V<sub>out</sub> = 5V * [<numerator>
              10000Ω </numerator>&frasl;<denominator> 10000Ω + 10000Ω</denominator>] = 5V * 0.5 = 
              <b>2.5V</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            R<sub>1</sub>'s voltage output ranges from 0 to 2.5V while for R<sub>2</sub>, the voltage 
            output ranges from 2.5V to 5V. Together, they combine for the full range of 0 to 5V. 
            <b>Either one is valid</b>; what matters is whether we want the output to default to 0V 
            or 5V (or in between) when the variable resistor is at a particular end.

          3. AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. 
          Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. 
          How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          If we had a 10-bit PWM means we would then expect values between 0 to 1023, instead 
          of the normal 255, because now we can get values up to 2<sup>10</sup> = 1023. 
          Therefore, the code would be "outputYValue = map(yval, 0, 1023, 0, 1023);".
        </p>
        <p>
          If we had a 16-bit analog-to-digital convertor instead, we can now read ADC values up 
          to 2<sup>16</sup> = 65535. The code would then be "outputYValue = map(yval, 0, 65535, 
          0, 255);" as we're compressing that large amount of ADC values to 0-255.
