        <p>Schematic for 3 independent LEDs in a circuit</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          First, I created a schematic (left) for 3 LEDs that connect to Arduino 
          and implemented as a circuit on my breadboard. Later, I wrote firmware 
          in an .ino file that made the 3 LEDS blink independently, in a pattern.

      <h2>Resistance Calculation</h2>
      <p>I used yellow, green, and red LEDs that have a 1.8V drop.</p>
      <p>5V - 1.8V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>3.2V = 0.02A * R</p>
      <p>R = 3.2V / 0.02A</p>
      <p>R = 160立</p>
      <p>This means that each circuit requires a resistance of at least 160立. 
        Therefore, I used a 220立 resistor, as that is the closest value over 
        160.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          I brought the schematic to life, choosing pins 13, 10, and 4 and yellow, 
          green, and red LEDs to output the blinks. Each independent path consists 
          of going from the respective pin, to a 220立 resistor, to the LED, to ground.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        Then, I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement a pattern of blinking 
        lights. The order goes: yellow, green, then red light up, then yellow, green, 
        red turns off. Full code below.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
        void setup() {
          pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // initializing digital pin 13 as an output
          pinMode(10, OUTPUT); // initializing digital pin 10 as an output
          pinMode(4, OUTPUT); // initializing digital pin 4 as an output
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turns ON LED connected to pin 13
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
          digitalWrite(10, HIGH); // turns ON LED connected to pin 10
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
          digitalWrite(4, HIGH); // turns ON LED connected to pin 4
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
          digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turns OFF LED connected to pin 13
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
          digitalWrite(10, LOW); // turns OFF LED connected to pin 10
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
          digitalWrite(4, LOW); // turns OFF LED connected to pin 4
          delay(500); // waits for half a second
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>Here is the final output operation! Warning: it is bright.</p>

            1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage 
            across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.

          <img src="images/A1_graph.jpeg">
          <p>
            This graph shows the change in voltage for each LED as time goes on 
            in seconds. When the line is at 5V, that means the LED is on. It is 
            off at 0V.

            2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? 
            How much current would that draw?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since there are 14 digital pins (0-13) in an Arduino, I think 14 outputs 
            could be drawn to make 14 different LEDs blink independently. Each pin 
            individually draws 20mA or 0.02A, so if all 14 are used, then the total 
            current would be about 280mA or 0.28A drawn.

            3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell 
            that they are blinking?
          </h3>
          <p>
            After some testing, I found that 12ms is the threshhold where I could no 
            longer tell that the LED was blinking.
