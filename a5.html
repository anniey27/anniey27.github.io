      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I created a schematic (below) for a DHT sensor (which reads temperature and 
        humidity) that takes power from the Arduino, PWM signal from digital pin 4, 
        and goes to ground. On the right of the schematic, I have an external power 
        supply of a 9V battery powering a fan motor which is connected in parallel 
        with a flyback diode to prevent voltage spikes. Then, this goes into a 
        N-MOSFET transistor where the power goes into drain, the gate goes into 
        digital pin 9 (to read PWM signals), and source goes into ground.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          Then, I built my circuit based on my schematic, starting with a 9V battery to 
          power my fan motor. Between the positive (red) and negative (black) wires from 
          the motor, I used a flyback diode which prevents voltage spikes. The negative 
          wire is then also connected to the drain from the N-MOSFET transistor (with 
          the white wire), which its gate is read from pin 9 (blue wire) and source goes 
          to ground. My arduino board's 5V powers my DHT motor, which reads from pin 4 
          and also goes to ground. Power is in red wires while ground is always in black.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement this circuit where as soon as the 
        DHT11 sensor reads a temperature has passed a certain threshhold, the fan turns on. 
        If it's below the threshhold, the fan turns or remains off. I used the serial 
        monitor to read the temperature values in my room to help me determine a warmer 
        temperature to use as my temperature threshhold. My room was around 18 degrees 
        Celcius, so I set the threshhold to be 20 degrees Celcuius.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // installing libraries for using DHT 11 sensor
        #include &ltAdafruit_Sensor.h&gt
        #include &ltDHT.h&gt
        #include &ltDHT_U.h&gt

        // defining digital pin connected to DHT sensor (sends signal)
        #define DHTPIN 4
        // defining DHT 11 sensor
        #define DHTTYPE DHT11
        // defining PWN pin that controls fan motor
        #define FAN_PIN 9

        // initialize DHT sensor 
        DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

        // 20 degrees C is the threshhold for when this fan turns on
        // found through testing with serial monitor
        int TEMP_THRESHHOLD = 20;


        void setup() {
            // beginning serial monitor
            Serial.begin(9600);

            // beginning DHT sensor
            dht.begin(); 

            // setting the fan control pin as an output
            pinMode(FAN_PIN, OUTPUT);

            // start with the fan off
            analogWrite(FAN_PIN, 0);
        }


        void loop() {
            // wait a few seconds between readings for stability
            delay(2000); 

            // reads temperature from DHT sensor
            float temp = dht.readTemperature();
            
            // printing temp values from sensor for testing/debugging
            Serial.print("Temperature: ");
            Serial.print(temp);
            Serial.println(" °C");

            // checking if temperature meets the threshhold, fan turns on if meets temp threshhold
            if (temp >= TEMP_THRESHHOLD) {
                // turn the fan on at a quarter of its speed (PWM value 64 out of 255)
                analogWrite(FAN_PIN, 64);
            } else {
                // if temp is not at threshhold, fan turns off
                analogWrite(FAN_PIN, 0);
            }
        }

      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Here is the final output operation! Before the video starts I am blowing
        hot air towards the sensor to bring it up above the temperature threshhold. 
        The video starts right before it reaches the threshhold value, prompting the 
        fan to turn on.

            <h3>
            1. This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet transistor: 
            <a href="https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdf" target=”_blank”>
                https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdf</a>
            What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Pin 2 on the n-mosfet transistor is drain; pin 3 is source. In the 
              "Maximum Ratings" table in the datasheet, I looked for the drain current parameter, 
              I<sub>D</sub>. In row 3, it looks like the maximum current for I<sub>D</sub> is 
              <b>37.2 A</b> for when the device is operating continously (normal operation). 
              This is under the condition that T<sub>C</sub> = +25°C, meaning this is assuming 
              the transistor is kept at a value of 25 degrees Celcius. However, if it's only 
              operating in short bursts, row 4 indicates that the maximum amount of current is 
              I<sub>DM</sub> = <b>80 A</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The circuit I created draws much less current than 37.2 A. I used a 3-6V 
              motor for the fan. Looking at this <a href="https://bc-robotics.com/shop/3-6v-dc-hobby-motor-260/#:~:text=DC%20motors%20come%20in%20all,Speed%20(6V):%2010000%20RPM" target=”_blank”>
                website</a> (the closest I could find since I 
              could not find a specific datasheet), at max voltage 6V, the motor draws a 
              current of 0.13 A. Because the motor current is also the current that flows 
              through the transistor (when it's on), the transistor in my circuit is only 
              handling 0.13 A. This is quite safe considering it's much less than the 
              transistor's max rating of 37.2 A.
