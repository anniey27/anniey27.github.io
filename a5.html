      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I created a schematic (below) for a DHT sensor (which reads temperature and 
        humidity) that takes power from the Arduino, PWM signal from digital pin 4, 
        and goes to ground. On the right of the schematic, I have an external power 
        supply of a 9V battery powering a fan motor which is connected in parallel 
        with a flyback diode to prevent voltage spikes. Then, this goes into a 
        N-MOSFET transistor where the power goes into drain, the gate goes into 
        digital pin 9 (to read PWM signals), and source goes into ground.

        <h2>Building the Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          Then, I built my circuit based on my schematic, starting with a 9V battery to 
          power my fan motor. Between the positive and negative wires from the motor, I 
          used a flyback diode which prevents voltage spikes. The negative wire is then 
          also connected to the drain from the N-MOSFET transistor
          
          connecting pin 2 to a 1 megaohm resistor (for input) 
          sending the signal to pin 4. I used an alligator clip to connect my resistor to my 
          object of choice, which was a metal hook clasp. Touching the hook clasp would activate 
          and send a signal back to the circuit. Then, I connected my servo motor to power, 
          ground, and pin 9, which would send a PWM signal to the motor.

      <h2>Coding the Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        I coded the firmware in an .ino file to implement a circuit where as soon as the 
        sensor reads that the metal object has been directly touched, the servo motor 
        position turns 180 degrees. It stays unmoving at 0 degrees otherwise. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the serial monitor to read the sensor values and test what value would be 
        best to use as the threshhold value for the system to know the metal object was 
        touched. Realizing that at neutral/sitting/no-touching the sensor value is less 
        than 100 and that touching the object brings it up to around 2000, I set the touch 
        threshhold value to be at 1000. So the servo motor only changes position if that it 
        senses the threshhold value or above it.

      <p>
        Here is the final output operation! At the very start of the video I blow 
        hot air towards the sensor to bring it up above the temperature threshhold. 
        By reaching it, the fan then turns on.

        <div class="A1questions">
          <div class="vertical">
            <h3>
            1. Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
            <p><pre><code>for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}</code></p></pre>Draw a graph 
            with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to 
            ground.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Pin 9 sends the PWM (pulse width modulation) signal to the servo, and the width of 
              the signal determines the servo's position. It varies between 1 ms and 2 ms and the 
              voltage alternates between 0V and 5V. For a fixed period of 20 ms, the pulse width 
              increases from 1ms to 20ms. As the voltage oscillates between 0V and 5V, the amount 
              of time the signal is at 5V gradually increases while the amount of time that the 
              signal is at 0V gradually decreases. The PWM signal changes to control the servo's 
              position.
